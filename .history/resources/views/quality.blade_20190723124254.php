                                            <h4>VPI</h4>
                                            <p>VVPI (Vacuum Pressure Impregnation) is an incorporated and advance technology for wood treatment. The purpose of the Vacuum Pressure treatment is to force preservative chemicals deep into the cellular structure of the wood for assuming complete protection against Fungus, Insects, Termite and Pests. The preservative chemical acts as a barrier between the wood and biological deterioration agents so that the service life of wood can be substantially increased. For Vacuum Pressure Impregnation process, moisture of wood reduced before the application of the chemicals. In case of round logs treatments, logs been debarked by using various equipments so the chemical passes through into the wood porous. VPI technology ensures the high durability of products. A technology that allows the active and proactive ingredients to better penetrate the wood fibers ensuring superior protection against Fungus and other pathogens. As a result of VPI, it is possible to enjoy the warmth and beauty of areas covered and decorated with wood for a long time. </p>
